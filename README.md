# Movie Lover App

**Description**
\nCreating a movie streaming app, which helps you find out more about movies you want to watch. Movie page prodives you with basic information about the film.

**What app features now:**

- Movies detail page features - title, poster, synopsis, trailer, ranking from IMBD & Rotten Totamoes & Metacritics, year of release and genres
- Trailers on movies detail page are perfectly working and open in YouTube
- Trailers on the main page is not clickable yet

**Data location**
\nNow all data is written is ArraysLists and all images is stored in the project. 
In the near future I am planning to implement parsing data from JSON file from The Open Movie Database, which is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information.
